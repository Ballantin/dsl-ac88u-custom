.SH MATCH EXTENSIONS
iptables can use extended packet matching modules
with the \fB\-m\fP or \fB\-\-match\fP
options, followed by the matching module name; after these, various
extra command line options become available, depending on the specific
module.  You can specify multiple extended match modules in one line,
and you can use the \fB\-h\fP or \fB\-\-help\fP
options after the module has been specified to receive help specific
to that module.
.PP
If the \fB\-p\fP or \fB\-\-protocol\fP was specified and if and only if an
unknown option is encountered, iptables will try load a match module of the
same name as the protocol, to try making the option available.

.TP
\fB\-\-hl\-gt\fP \fIvalue\fP
Matches if Hop Limit is greater than \fIvalue\fP.
.SS icmp (IPv4-specific)
This extension can be used if `\-\-protocol icmp' is specified. It
provides the following option:
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-icmp\-type\fP {\fItype\fP[\fB/\fP\fIcode\fP]|\fItypename\fP}
This allows specification of the ICMP type, which can be a numeric
ICMP type, type/code pair, or one of the ICMP type names shown by the command
.nf
 iptables \-p icmp \-h
.fi
.SS icmp6 (IPv6-specific)
This extension can be used if `\-\-protocol ipv6\-icmp' or `\-\-protocol icmpv6' is
specified. It provides the following option:
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-icmpv6\-type\fP \fItype\fP[\fB/\fP\fIcode\fP]|\fItypename\fP

.fi
.SS ipv6header (IPv6-specific)
This module matches IPv6 extension headers and/or upper layer header.
.TP
\fB\-\-soft\fP

\fB\-\-header\fP.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-header\fP \fIheader\fP[\fB,\fP\fIheader\fP...]
Matches the packet which EXACTLY includes all specified headers. The headers
encapsulated with ESP header are out of scope.

any IPv6 extension headers
.TP
\fBproto\fP

/etc/protocols and numeric value also allowed. The number 255 is equivalent to
\fBproto\fP.
.SS length
This module matches the length of the layer-3 payload (e.g. layer-4 packet)
of a packet against a specific value
or range of values.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-length\fP \fIlength\fP[\fB:\fP\fIlength\fP]
.SS limit
This module matches at a limited rate using a token bucket filter.
A rule using this extension will match until this limit is reached.
It can be used in combination with the
.B LOG
target to give limited logging, for example.
.PP
xt_limit has no negation support - you will have to use \-m hashlimit !
\-\-hashlimit \fIrate\fP in this case whilst omitting \-\-hashlimit\-mode.
.TP
\fB\-\-limit\fP \fIrate\fP[\fB/second\fP|\fB/minute\fP|\fB/hour\fP|\fB/day\fP]
Maximum average matching rate: specified as a number, with an optional
`/second', `/minute', `/hour', or `/day' suffix; the default is
3/hour.

recharged by one every time the limit specified above is not reached,
up to this number; the default is 5.
.SS mac
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-mac\-source\fP \fIaddress\fP
Match source MAC address.  It must be of the form XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX.
Note that this only makes sense for packets coming from an Ethernet device
and entering the
.BR PREROUTING ,
.B FORWARD
or
.B INPUT
chains.
.SS mark
This module matches the netfilter mark field associated with a packet
(which can be set using the
.B MARK
target below).
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-mark\fP \fIvalue\fP[\fB/\fP\fImask\fP]
Matches packets with the given unsigned mark value (if a \fImask\fP is
specified, this is logically ANDed with the \fImask\fP before the
comparison).
.SS mh (IPv6-specific)
This extension is loaded if `\-\-protocol ipv6\-mh' or `\-\-protocol mh' is
specified. It provides the following option:
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-mh\-type\fP \fItype\fP[\fB:\fP\fItype\fP]
This allows specification of the Mobility Header(MH) type, which can be
a numeric MH
.IR type ,
.IR type
or one of the MH type names shown by the command
.nf
 ip6tables \-p ipv6\-mh \-h
.fi
.SS owner
This module attempts to match various characteristics of the packet creator,
for locally generated packets. This match is only valid in the OUTPUT and
POSTROUTING chains. Forwarded packets do not have any socket associated with
them. Packets from kernel threads do have a socket, but usually no owner.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-uid\-owner\fP \fIusername\fP
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-uid\-owner\fP \fIuserid\fP[\fB\-\fP\fIuserid\fP]
Matches if the packet socket's file structure (if it has one) is owned by the
given user. You may also specify a numerical UID, or an UID range.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-gid\-owner\fP \fIgroupname\fP
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-gid\-owner\fP \fIgroupid\fP[\fB\-\fP\fIgroupid\fP]

.TP
\fB\-\-dir\fP {\fBin\fP|\fBout\fP}
Used to select whether to match the policy used for decapsulation or the
policy that will be used for encapsulation.
.B in

.B PREROUTING, INPUT and FORWARD
chains,
.B out
is valid in the
.B POSTROUTING, OUTPUT and FORWARD
chains.
.TP
\fB\-\-pol\fP {\fBnone\fP|\fBipsec\fP}
Matches if the packet is subject to IPsec processing. \fB\-\-pol none\fP
cannot be combined with \fB\-\-strict\fP.
.TP
\fB\-\-strict\fP
Selects whether to match the exact policy or match if any rule of
the policy matches the given policy.
.PP
For each policy element that is to be described, one can use one or more of
the following options. When \fB\-\-strict\fP is in effect, at least one must be
used per element.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-reqid\fP \fIid\fP
Matches the reqid of the policy rule. The reqid can be specified with
.B setkey(8)

Only valid with \fB\-\-mode tunnel\fP.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-tunnel\-dst\fP \fIaddr\fP[\fB/\fP\fImask\fP]
Matches the destination end-point address of a tunnel mode SA.
Only valid with \fB\-\-mode tunnel\fP.
.TP
\fB\-\-next\fP
Start the next element in the policy specification. Can only be used with
\fB\-\-strict\fP.
.SS rt (IPv6-specific)
Match on IPv6 routing header
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-rt\-type\fP \fItype\fP
Match the type (numeric).
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-rt\-segsleft\fP \fInum\fP[\fB:\fP\fInum\fP]
Match the `segments left' field (range).
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-rt\-len\fP \fIlength\fP
Match the length of this header.
.TP
\fB\-\-rt\-0\-res\fP
Match the reserved field, too (type=0)
.TP
\fB\-\-rt\-0\-addrs\fP \fIaddr\fP[\fB,\fP\fIaddr\fP...]
Match type=0 addresses (list).
.TP
\fB\-\-rt\-0\-not\-strict\fP
List of type=0 addresses is not a strict list.
.SS state
The "state" module is an obsolete version of "conntrack".
"state" allows access to the connection tracking state for this packet.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-state\fP \fIstate\fP
Where state is a comma separated list of the connection states to match. Only a
subset of the states unterstood by "conntrack" are recognized: \fBINVALID\fP,
\fBESTABLISHED\fP, \fBNEW\fP, \fBRELATED\fP or \fBUNTRACKED\fP. For their
description, see the "conntrack" heading in this manpage.
.SS tcp
These extensions can be used if `\-\-protocol tcp' is specified. It
provides the following options:
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-source\-port\fP,\fB\-\-sport\fP \fIport\fP[\fB:\fP\fIport\fP]
Source port or port range specification. This can either be a service
name or a port number. An inclusive range can also be specified,
using the format \fIfirst\fP\fB:\fP\fIlast\fP.
If the first port is omitted, "0" is assumed; if the last is omitted,
"65535" is assumed.
If the first port is greater than the second one they will be swapped.
The flag
\fB\-\-sport\fP
is a convenient alias for this option.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-destination\-port\fP,\fB\-\-dport\fP \fIport\fP[\fB:\fP\fIport\fP]
Destination port or port range specification.  The flag
\fB\-\-dport\fP
is a convenient alias for this option.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-tcp\-flags\fP \fImask\fP \fIcomp\fP
Match when the TCP flags are as specified.  The first argument \fImask\fP is the
flags which we should examine, written as a comma-separated list, and
the second argument \fIcomp\fP is a comma-separated list of flags which must be
set.  Flags are:
.BR "SYN ACK FIN RST URG PSH ALL NONE" .
Hence the command
.nf
 iptables \-A FORWARD \-p tcp \-\-tcp\-flags SYN,ACK,FIN,RST SYN
.fi
will only match packets with the SYN flag set, and the ACK, FIN and
RST flags unset.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-syn\fP
Only match TCP packets with the SYN bit set and the ACK,RST and FIN bits
cleared.  Such packets are used to request TCP connection initiation;
for example, blocking such packets coming in an interface will prevent
incoming TCP connections, but outgoing TCP connections will be
unaffected.
It is equivalent to \fB\-\-tcp\-flags SYN,RST,ACK,FIN SYN\fP.
If the "!" flag precedes the "\-\-syn", the sense of the
option is inverted.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-tcp\-option\fP \fInumber\fP
Match if TCP option set.
.SS udp
These extensions can be used if `\-\-protocol udp' is specified. It
provides the following options:
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-source\-port\fP,\fB\-\-sport\fP \fIport\fP[\fB:\fP\fIport\fP]
Source port or port range specification.
See the description of the
\fB\-\-source\-port\fP
option of the TCP extension for details.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-destination\-port\fP,\fB\-\-dport\fP \fIport\fP[\fB:\fP\fIport\fP]
Destination port or port range specification.
See the description of the
\fB\-\-destination\-port\fP
option of the TCP extension for details.
.SH TARGET EXTENSIONS
iptables can use extended target modules: the following are included
in the standard distribution.
.\" @TARGET@
.SS DNAT (IPv4-specific)
This target is only valid in the
.B nat
table, in the
.B PREROUTING
and
.B OUTPUT
chains, and user-defined chains which are only called from those
chains.  It specifies that the destination address of the packet
should be modified (and all future packets in this connection will
also be mangled), and rules should cease being examined.  It takes one
type of option:
.TP
\fB\-\-to\-destination\fP [\fIipaddr\fP[\fB\-\fP\fIipaddr\fP]][\fB:\fP\fIport\fP[\fB\-\fP\fIport\fP]]
which can specify a single new destination IP address, an inclusive
range of IP addresses, and optionally, a port range (which is only
valid if the rule also specifies
\fB\-p tcp\fP
or
\fB\-p udp\fP).
If no port range is specified, then the destination port will never be
modified. If no IP address is specified then only the destination port
will be modified.

In Kernels up to 2.6.10 you can add several \-\-to\-destination options. For
those kernels, if you specify more than one destination address, either via an
address range or multiple \-\-to\-destination options, a simple round-robin (one
after another in cycle) load balancing takes place between these addresses.
Later Kernels (>= 2.6.11-rc1) don't have the ability to NAT to multiple ranges
anymore.
.TP
\fB\-\-random\fP
If option
\fB\-\-random\fP
is used then port mapping will be randomized (kernel >= 2.6.22).
.TP
\fB\-\-persistent\fP
Gives a client the same source-/destination-address for each connection.
This supersedes the SAME target. Support for persistent mappings is available
from 2.6.29-rc2.
.SS DSCP
This target allows to alter the value of the DSCP bits within the TOS
header of the IPv4 packet.  As this manipulates a packet, it can only
be used in the mangle table.
.TP
\fB\-\-set\-dscp\fP \fIvalue\fP
Set the DSCP field to a numerical value (can be decimal or hex)
.TP
\fB\-\-set\-dscp\-class\fP \fIclass\fP
Set the DSCP field to a DiffServ class.
.SS HL (IPv6-specific)
This is used to modify the Hop Limit field in IPv6 header. The Hop Limit field
is similar to what is known as TTL value in IPv4.  Setting or incrementing the
Hop Limit field can potentially be very dangerous, so it should be avoided at
any cost. This target is only valid in
.B mangle
table.
.PP
.B Don't ever set or increment the value on packets that leave your local network!
.TP
\fB\-\-hl\-set\fP \fIvalue\fP
Set the Hop Limit to `value'.
.TP
\fB\-\-hl\-dec\fP \fIvalue\fP
Decrement the Hop Limit `value' times.
.TP
\fB\-\-hl\-inc\fP \fIvalue\fP
Increment the Hop Limit `value' times.
.SS LOG (IPv6-specific)
Turn on kernel logging of matching packets.  When this option is set
for a rule, the Linux kernel will print some information on all
matching packets (like most IPv6 IPv6-header fields) via the kernel log
(where it can be read with
.I dmesg
or 
.IR syslogd (8)).
This is a "non-terminating target", i.e. rule traversal continues at
the next rule.  So if you want to LOG the packets you refuse, use two
separate rules with the same matching criteria, first using target LOG
then DROP (or REJECT).
.TP
\fB\-\-log\-level\fP \fIlevel\fP
Level of logging (numeric or see \fIsyslog.conf\fP(5)).
.TP
\fB\-\-log\-prefix\fP \fIprefix\fP
Prefix log messages with the specified prefix; up to 29 letters long,
and useful for distinguishing messages in the logs.
.TP
\fB\-\-log\-tcp\-sequence\fP
Log TCP sequence numbers. This is a security risk if the log is
readable by users.
.TP
\fB\-\-log\-tcp\-options\fP
Log options from the TCP packet header.
.TP
\fB\-\-log\-ip\-options\fP
Log options from the IPv6 packet header.
.TP
\fB\-\-log\-uid\fP
Log the userid of the process which generated the packet.
.SS LOG (IPv4-specific)
Turn on kernel logging of matching packets.  When this option is set
for a rule, the Linux kernel will print some information on all
matching packets (like most IP header fields) via the kernel log
(where it can be read with
.I dmesg
or 
.IR syslogd (8)).
This is a "non-terminating target", i.e. rule traversal continues at
the next rule.  So if you want to LOG the packets you refuse, use two
separate rules with the same matching criteria, first using target LOG
then DROP (or REJECT).
.TP
\fB\-\-log\-level\fP \fIlevel\fP
Level of logging (numeric or see \fIsyslog.conf\fP(5)).
.TP
\fB\-\-log\-prefix\fP \fIprefix\fP
Prefix log messages with the specified prefix; up to 29 letters long,
and useful for distinguishing messages in the logs.
.TP
\fB\-\-log\-tcp\-sequence\fP
Log TCP sequence numbers. This is a security risk if the log is
readable by users.
.TP
\fB\-\-log\-tcp\-options\fP
Log options from the TCP packet header.
.TP
\fB\-\-log\-ip\-options\fP
Log options from the IP packet header.
.TP
\fB\-\-log\-uid\fP
Log the userid of the process which generated the packet.
.SS MARK
This target is used to set the Netfilter mark value associated with the packet.
It can, for example, be used in conjunction with routing based on fwmark (needs
iproute2). If you plan on doing so, note that the mark needs to be set in the
PREROUTING chain of the mangle table to affect routing.
The mark field is 32 bits wide.
.TP
\fB\-\-set\-xmark\fP \fIvalue\fP[\fB/\fP\fImask\fP]
Zeroes out the bits given by \fImask\fP and XORs \fIvalue\fP into the packet
mark ("nfmark"). If \fImask\fP is omitted, 0xFFFFFFFF is assumed.
.TP
\fB\-\-set\-mark\fP \fIvalue\fP[\fB/\fP\fImask\fP]
Zeroes out the bits given by \fImask\fP and ORs \fIvalue\fP into the packet
mark. If \fImask\fP is omitted, 0xFFFFFFFF is assumed.
.PP
The following mnemonics are available:
.TP
\fB\-\-and\-mark\fP \fIbits\fP
Binary AND the nfmark with \fIbits\fP. (Mnemonic for \fB\-\-set\-xmark
0/\fP\fIinvbits\fP, where \fIinvbits\fP is the binary negation of \fIbits\fP.)
.TP
\fB\-\-or\-mark\fP \fIbits\fP
Binary OR the nfmark with \fIbits\fP. (Mnemonic for \fB\-\-set\-xmark\fP
\fIbits\fP\fB/\fP\fIbits\fP.)
.TP
\fB\-\-xor\-mark\fP \fIbits\fP
Binary XOR the nfmark with \fIbits\fP. (Mnemonic for \fB\-\-set\-xmark\fP
\fIbits\fP\fB/0\fP.)
.SS MASQUERADE (IPv4-specific)
This target is only valid in the
.B nat
table, in the
.B POSTROUTING
chain.  It should only be used with dynamically assigned IP (dialup)
connections: if you have a static IP address, you should use the SNAT
target.  Masquerading is equivalent to specifying a mapping to the IP
address of the interface the packet is going out, but also has the
effect that connections are
.I forgotten
when the interface goes down.  This is the correct behavior when the
next dialup is unlikely to have the same interface address (and hence
any established connections are lost anyway).
.TP
\fB\-\-to\-ports\fP \fIport\fP[\fB\-\fP\fIport\fP]
This specifies a range of source ports to use, overriding the default
.B SNAT
source port-selection heuristics (see above).  This is only valid
if the rule also specifies
\fB\-p tcp\fP
or
\fB\-p udp\fP.
.TP
\fB\-\-random\fP
Randomize source port mapping
If option
\fB\-\-random\fP
is used then port mapping will be randomized (kernel >= 2.6.21).
.RS
.PP
.SS NFQUEUE
This target is an extension of the QUEUE target. As opposed to QUEUE, it allows
you to put a packet into any specific queue, identified by its 16-bit queue
number.
It can only be used with Kernel versions 2.6.14 or later, since it requires
the
.B
nfnetlink_queue
kernel support. The \fBqueue-balance\fP option was added in Linux 2.6.31,
\fBqueue-bypass\fP in 2.6.39.
.TP
\fB\-\-queue\-num\fP \fIvalue\fP
This specifies the QUEUE number to use. Valid queue numbers are 0 to 65535. The default value is 0.
.PP
.TP
\fB\-\-queue\-balance\fP \fIvalue\fP\fB:\fP\fIvalue\fP
This specifies a range of queues to use. Packets are then balanced across the given queues.
This is useful for multicore systems: start multiple instances of the userspace program on
queues x, x+1, .. x+n and use "\-\-queue\-balance \fIx\fP\fB:\fP\fIx+n\fP".
Packets belonging to the same connection are put into the same nfqueue.
.PP
.TP
\fB\-\-queue\-bypass\fP
By default, if no userspace program is listening on an NFQUEUE, then all packets that are to be queued
are dropped.  When this option is used, the NFQUEUE rule is silently bypassed instead. The packet
will move on to the next rule.
.SS NOTRACK
This target disables connection tracking for all packets matching that rule.
It is obsoleted by \-j CT \-\-notrack. Like CT, NOTRACK can only be used in
the \fBraw\fP table.
.SS REDIRECT (IPv4-specific)
This target is only valid in the
.B nat
table, in the
.B PREROUTING
and
.B OUTPUT
chains, and user-defined chains which are only called from those
chains.  It redirects the packet to the machine itself by changing the
destination IP to the primary address of the incoming interface
(locally-generated packets are mapped to the 127.0.0.1 address).
.TP
\fB\-\-to\-ports\fP \fIport\fP[\fB\-\fP\fIport\fP]
This specifies a destination port or range of ports to use: without
this, the destination port is never altered.  This is only valid
if the rule also specifies
\fB\-p tcp\fP
or
\fB\-p udp\fP.
.TP
\fB\-\-random\fP
If option
\fB\-\-random\fP
is used then port mapping will be randomized (kernel >= 2.6.22).
.RS
.PP
.SS REJECT (IPv6-specific)
This is used to send back an error packet in response to the matched
packet: otherwise it is equivalent to 
.B DROP
so it is a terminating TARGET, ending rule traversal.
This target is only valid in the
.BR INPUT ,
.B FORWARD
and
.B OUTPUT
chains, and user-defined chains which are only called from those
chains.  The following option controls the nature of the error packet
returned:
.TP
\fB\-\-reject\-with\fP \fItype\fP
The type given can be
\fBicmp6\-no\-route\fP,
\fBno\-route\fP,
\fBicmp6\-adm\-prohibited\fP,
\fBadm\-prohibited\fP,
\fBicmp6\-addr\-unreachable\fP,
\fBaddr\-unreach\fP,
\fBicmp6\-port\-unreachable\fP or
\fBport\-unreach\fP
which return the appropriate ICMPv6 error message (\fBport\-unreach\fP is
the default). Finally, the option
\fBtcp\-reset\fP
can be used on rules which only match the TCP protocol: this causes a
TCP RST packet to be sent back.  This is mainly useful for blocking 
.I ident
(113/tcp) probes which frequently occur when sending mail to broken mail
hosts (which won't accept your mail otherwise).
\fBtcp\-reset\fP
can only be used with kernel versions 2.6.14 or later.
.SS REJECT (IPv4-specific)
This is used to send back an error packet in response to the matched
packet: otherwise it is equivalent to
.B DROP
so it is a terminating TARGET, ending rule traversal.
This target is only valid in the
.BR INPUT ,
.B FORWARD
and
.B OUTPUT
chains, and user-defined chains which are only called from those
chains.  The following option controls the nature of the error packet
returned:
.TP
\fB\-\-reject\-with\fP \fItype\fP
The type given can be
\fBicmp\-net\-unreachable\fP,
\fBicmp\-host\-unreachable\fP,
\fBicmp\-port\-unreachable\fP,
\fBicmp\-proto\-unreachable\fP,
\fBicmp\-net\-prohibited\fP,
\fBicmp\-host\-prohibited\fP or
\fBicmp\-admin\-prohibited\fP (*)
which return the appropriate ICMP error message (\fBport\-unreachable\fP is
the default).  The option
\fBtcp\-reset\fP
can be used on rules which only match the TCP protocol: this causes a
TCP RST packet to be sent back.  This is mainly useful for blocking 
.I ident
(113/tcp) probes which frequently occur when sending mail to broken mail
hosts (which won't accept your mail otherwise).
.PP
(*) Using icmp\-admin\-prohibited with kernels that do not support it will result in a plain DROP instead of REJECT
.SS SNAT (IPv4-specific)
This target is only valid in the
.B nat
table, in the
.B POSTROUTING
chain.  It specifies that the source address of the packet should be
modified (and all future packets in this connection will also be
mangled), and rules should cease being examined.  It takes one type
of option:
.TP
\fB\-\-to\-source\fP [\fIipaddr\fP[\fB\-\fP\fIipaddr\fP]][\fB:\fP\fIport\fP[\fB\-\fP\fIport\fP]]
which can specify a single new source IP address, an inclusive range
of IP addresses, and optionally, a port range (which is only valid if
the rule also specifies
\fB\-p tcp\fP
or
\fB\-p udp\fP).
If no port range is specified, then source ports below 512 will be
mapped to other ports below 512: those between 512 and 1023 inclusive
will be mapped to ports below 1024, and other ports will be mapped to
1024 or above. Where possible, no port alteration will occur.

In Kernels up to 2.6.10, you can add several \-\-to\-source options. For those
kernels, if you specify more than one source address, either via an address
range or multiple \-\-to\-source options, a simple round-robin (one after another
in cycle) takes place between these addresses.
Later Kernels (>= 2.6.11-rc1) don't have the ability to NAT to multiple ranges
anymore.
.TP
\fB\-\-random\fP
If option
\fB\-\-random\fP
is used then port mapping will be randomized (kernel >= 2.6.21).
.TP
\fB\-\-persistent\fP
Gives a client the same source-/destination-address for each connection.
This supersedes the SAME target. Support for persistent mappings is available
from 2.6.29-rc2.
.SS TCPMSS
This target allows to alter the MSS value of TCP SYN packets, to control
the maximum size for that connection (usually limiting it to your
outgoing interface's MTU minus 40 for IPv4 or 60 for IPv6, respectively).
Of course, it can only be used
in conjunction with
\fB\-p tcp\fP.
.PP
This target is used to overcome criminally braindead ISPs or servers
which block "ICMP Fragmentation Needed" or "ICMPv6 Packet Too Big"
packets.  The symptoms of this
problem are that everything works fine from your Linux
firewall/router, but machines behind it can never exchange large
packets:
.IP 1. 4
Web browsers connect, then hang with no data received.
.IP 2. 4
Small mail works fine, but large emails hang.
.IP 3. 4
ssh works fine, but scp hangs after initial handshaking.
.PP
Workaround: activate this option and add a rule to your firewall
configuration like:
.IP
 iptables \-t mangle \-A FORWARD \-p tcp \-\-tcp\-flags SYN,RST SYN
             \-j TCPMSS \-\-clamp\-mss\-to\-pmtu
.TP
\fB\-\-set\-mss\fP \fIvalue\fP
Explicitly sets MSS option to specified value. If the MSS of the packet is
already lower than \fIvalue\fP, it will \fBnot\fP be increased (from Linux
2.6.25 onwards) to avoid more problems with hosts relying on a proper MSS.
.TP
\fB\-\-clamp\-mss\-to\-pmtu\fP
Automatically clamp MSS value to (path_MTU \- 40 for IPv4; \-60 for IPv6).
This may not function as desired where asymmetric routes with differing
path MTU exist \(em the kernel uses the path MTU which it would use to send
packets from itself to the source and destination IP addresses. Prior to
Linux 2.6.25, only the path MTU to the destination IP address was
considered by this option; subsequent kernels also consider the path MTU
to the source IP address.
.PP
These options are mutually exclusive.
