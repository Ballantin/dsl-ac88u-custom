This directory contains a template RPM spec file with a makefile to
help build RPMs for an OpenL2TP release. It is included with OpenL2TP
source releases in order that other developers can more easily build
RPMs for their own environments.

You are encouraged to build RPMs if one doesn't already exist for your
setup on the OpenL2TP download site and contribute it. Here's how to do so.

1. Find out which kernel version and which CPU architecture you have.

   uname -r
   uname -p

2. Login as root and cd into this directory. Then type "make", with
   arguments specifying parameters of your system. e.g. to build RPMs
   for OpenL2TP 1.0 on an i586 CPU, do the following:

   make ARCH=i586 VER=1.0 \
	AUTHOR='My Name <my-email-address>' \
	TARGZ=/tmp/openl2tp-1.0.tar.gz

   Binary and source RPMs are copied back into this directory if they
   are built successfully.

   If the above command fails due to unresolved RPM dependencies,
   suitable versions must first be installed to resolve the dependency
   conflicts.

   To build an SMP version, use SMP=y:

   make ARCH=i586 VER=1.0 \
	AUTHOR='My Name <my-email-address>' \
	TARGZ=/tmp/openl2tp-1.0.tar.gz \
	SMP=y

   It shouldn't be necessary to edit the template RPM spec file,
   openl2tp.spec. The makefile substitutes parameters into the
   template. If changes are needed to the template, please do them
   such that configuration parameters are passed through the makefile
   and contribute a patch since it is likely that others may also
   benefit from your work.

4. Install and test your new RPMs.

   rpm -ivh <RPM-FILE>

5. Please contribute your RPMs to the OpenL2TP SourceForge site so
   that they can be added to the OpenL2TP download page.
