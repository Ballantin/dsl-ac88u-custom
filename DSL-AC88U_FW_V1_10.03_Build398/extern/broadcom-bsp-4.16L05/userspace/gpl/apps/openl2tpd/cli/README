Command Line Interface (CLI)
============================

The CLI library is written to enable its use in multiple
applications. Right now, it is distributed with OpenL2TP but in the
future it might be released under LGPL as a separate component.

Future Work
===========

- Cleanup code for use as a shared library.

- Documentation.
