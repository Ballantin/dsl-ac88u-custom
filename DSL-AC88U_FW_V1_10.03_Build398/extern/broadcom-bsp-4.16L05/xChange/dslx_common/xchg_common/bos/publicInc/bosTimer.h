/**

*
*  @brief   Provides operating system timers.
*
*           Timers are an OS component that keep track of elapsed time, and are
*           run off of the main system clock.  When the specified time
*           interval has elapsed, the OS abstraction internally sends an event
*           to the thread that owns it. This will unblock the task that is
*           waiting for the timer to expire.
*
*           Timers can be used in a one-shot or a repeating mode.
*
*           NOTE:  Unlike other BOS primitives, where some of the functions are
*           meant to be used by other tasks, all of the functions of BOS timers
*           can only be operated on by the task that created/owns it.  This is
*           because the event is only valid in the context of the owning task,
*           and in some operating systems a timer must be started by the task
*           that owns it. For this reason, it must never be accessible outside of
*           the task.
