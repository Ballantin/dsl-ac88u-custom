****************************************************************************
*    Description:
*
*     BOS events are generally used as a means of simple communication between
*     tasks, when one task needs to tell another task that a particular
*     event has occurred.  BOS events contain no other information about the
*     event, such as how many times it occurred, when it occurred, who sent
*     it, or any other data associated with the event.
*
*     When an event is created, you must specify the task that wants to receive
*     the notification.  This is because the event is valid only in the context
*     of the receiving task.  The sender of the event (who calls bosEventSend())
*     can be any task, including the task that created the event.
*
*     BOS event sets are a container class that allows individual sources of
*     events (like BOS events, BOS timer, etc) to be grouped together and
*     operated on simultaneously.  This is necessary because BOS events,
*     BOS timers, and others only allow you to operate on that particular
*     instance.  The primary use of this object is to allow a task to wait for
*     one or more of a set of events to occur.
*
*     Any BOS primitive that has an associated BOS event (such as BOS timer)
*     can be added to the event set.  For example, this allows a task to wait
*     for an event to be sent, or a timer to expire, which ever comes first.
*     A task can also wait for a combination of events before returning, such as
*     a received message and a timer expiration.
