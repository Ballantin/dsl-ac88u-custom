**  FUNCTION:   strCmpNoCaseSize
**
**  PURPOSE:    Performs case insensitive string comparison of the first 'n'
**              bytes of a given string.
**
**  PARAMETERS:
**              str1 - string to compare.
**              str2 - string to compare.
**              n    - number of bytes to be compared.
**
**  RETURNS:    0 if the strings are the same.
**              > 0 if str1 > str2.
**              < 0 if str1 < str2.
