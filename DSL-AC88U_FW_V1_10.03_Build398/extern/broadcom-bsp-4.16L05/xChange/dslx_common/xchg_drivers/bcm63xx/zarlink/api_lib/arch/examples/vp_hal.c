/**
 * VpHalHbiBootWr():
 *
 *  This is used by the VpBootLoad() function to send the boot stream to the
 * VCP.  This function is separate from VpHalHbiWrite(), for the following
 * reasons:
 *
 *  1. This function does not accept a command word; only data words.
 *  2. This function accepts uint8 data, instead of uint16 data.  Be careful
 *     not to assume that this data is word-aligned in memory.
 *  3. The HBI must be configured for big-endian data words while the boot
 *     stream is being transmitted, regardless of the endianness of the host
 *     platform.  This is because the boot image is an opaque stream of HBI
 *     command words and data words.  Therefore, commands and data cannot be
 *     distinguished for separate treatment by this function.  Since HBI
 *     command words are always big-endian, data words have to be big-endian,
 *     too.  The boot stream is stored big-endian in memory, even on little-
 *     endian hosts.
 *        If VpHalHbiInit() configures the HBI for little-endian data words,
 *     then this function must temporarily change the configuration by calling
 *     VpHalHbiCmd(HBI_CMD_CONFIGURE(...)), and change it back before
 *     returning.  In such a case, this function will need to swap each pair
 *     of bytes in the boot stream before sending.
 *        Another possibility is a little-endian host architecture, with the HBI
 *     bus configured for big-endian data words.  In this case, byte-swapping
 *     has to be done in VpHalHbiWrite() or in the glue logic between the host
 *     and the VCP. In these setups, VpHalHbiBootWr() does not need to
 *     reconfigure the  HBI.
 *  4. This function takes a VpImagePtrType pointer to char data, which is a
 *     platform-dependent type defined in vp_hal.h.
 *
 * Params
 *   uint8 deviceId: Device Id (chip select ID)
 *  'length' specifies the number of 16-bit words to write to the VCP.
 *  'pBuf' points into the boot stream.
 *
 * Returns
 *  HbiHalBootWr() returns TRUE on success, FALSE on failure.
 *
 * Notes
 *  THIS FUNCTION IS NOT REENTRANT!

 * to the command being passed. The EC register write/read command is the same
 * for every CSLAC device and added to this function. The only exception is
 * if the calling function is accessing the EC register (read), in which case
 * the EC write cannot occur.
