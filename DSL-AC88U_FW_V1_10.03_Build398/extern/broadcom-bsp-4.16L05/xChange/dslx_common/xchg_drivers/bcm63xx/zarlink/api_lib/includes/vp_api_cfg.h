     * Howler Tone will be provided on the line. To send UK Howler Tone the
     * application must do the following:
     *
     *      - Have the full version of VP_API-II (i.e., Le71SK0002)
     *      - Set VP_CLSAC_SEQ_EN to #define. Note: if setting VP_CLSAC_SEQ_EN
     *        to #define causes compiler errors, the Make process may either
     *        not be including the required *.c and *.h files or may be using
     *        the "Lite" version of the API (i.e., Le71SDKAPIL).
     *      - Create a Tone Cadence Profile with UK Howler Tone.
     *      - Provide this tone cadence to VpSetLineTone()
     *
     * There are two types of UK Howler Tones supported in the API:
     *
     *      - VP_UK_HOWLER_BTNR_VER15
     *          The BTNR Version 15 Howler Tone will perform a frequency sweep
     *          between [800Hz to 3200Hz] at a 500ms period. Total sweep from
     *          [800-3200-800] will be nominal 1 second +/-166ms. At each 1
     *          second interval over a total duration of 12 seconds the tone
     *          level will increase by 3dB for total level increase of 36dB.
     *          The final level will be a nominal +14.5dBm @ 600ohm on T/R
     *          when also used with VP_LINE_HOWLER or VP_LINE_HOWLER_POLREV
     *          line states (see VpSetLineState() in API Reference Guide).
     *
     *      - VP_UK_HOWLER_BTNR_DRAFT_G
     *          Draft 960-G Howler Tone is very similar to Version 15 with
     *          only a few differences. The frequency sweep is between [800Hz
     *          to 2500Hz] and the level varies by 3dB during the sweep
     *          interval such that the level at 2500Hz is ~3dB higher than the
     *          level at 800Hz. The total sweep time of 12 seconds is the same
     *          as well as the final output level of +14.5dBm @ 600ohm on T/R
     *          when also used with VP_LINE_HOWLER or VP_LINE_HOWLER_POLREV
     *          line states (see VpSetLineState() in API Reference Guide).
     *
     * The Application may choose which BTNR Specification to use when
     * generating the UK Howler Tone by setting VP_UK_HOWLER_IN_USE value as
     * follows:
     *
     *      To use BTNR Version 15:
     *          #define VP_UK_HOWLER_IN_USE VP_UK_HOWLER_BTNR_VER15
