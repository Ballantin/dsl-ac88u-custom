As of June 2005, Broadcom CMT cores are only used with the MIPS
architecture. This implementation of ITPC isn't really MIPS specific.
We may be able to use it for all CMT architectures. It depends on
how future CMTs are designed...for now, we'll keep the implementation
in the MIPS architecture folder.
